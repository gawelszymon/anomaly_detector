types of anomalis:
- point anomaly - data point that deviate significantly from the rest of the data
- contextual anomaly - depends on the surroundings contex, specially in  a time-series data.
- collective anomalies - a set of data points together indicate an anomaly, a few factor might means anomaly

Outliers - values that deviate significantly from the rest of the data.





Conclusions after silent anomalies researches:
In general model works properly when the outlies is much different than the original function.
So if we wanna detect even silents anomalies we have to use some enhancement

1. first of all we can apply dedicated detection for different anomaly types -
different for common reconstruction error, diffrent for frequency, phase, amplitude and so on

2. We can implement some function that can isolate some significant features in a purpose for
detection different anomalies types.
    - For TIME DOMAIN (point anomaly): Except for raw values we can use the derivatives to show
                       how function is changing
    - For FREQUENCY DOMAIN: magnitude of frequency components via Fast Fourier Transform
    - For PHASE: phase angles of frequency components
    - For AMPLITUDE (atenuation/noise): similar to time domain but we can implement amplitude envelope (obwiednia)
      or hilbert transformation
