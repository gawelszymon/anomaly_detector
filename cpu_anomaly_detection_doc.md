   DB_PORT=
   DB_SERVICE_NAME=

## Running the Pipeline

1. Navigate to the `cpu_detection` directory.
2. Execute the following scripts in order:
   - `cpu_train_autoencoder.py`
   - `cpu_anomaly_detection.py`

## Notes

- Ensure the database is running and accessible with the provided credentials.
   I connect to the VM with DB by ssh -L 1521:10.20.30.209:1521 opc@130.61.37.152
- The `.env` file must be in the root directory of the project.
